    "criteria": "Accuracy: The response should correctly address the question with precise facts and calculations.\nFactual Precision: Verify the correctness of facts, data, and the application of relevant laws or information.\nClarity and Accuracy: Information should be presented clearly, without errors or misrepresentations.\nRelevance: Ensure that all information provided is pertinent to the question and contributes to a correct understanding.",
    "evaluation_steps": [
        "Identify all factual claims within the 'actual output'. Using a chain-of-thought approach, list each discrete fact. For example, if the response states 'The land tax in Queensland for properties valued at X is Y%', note this as a factual claim that can be checked against the known data or the user’s expected output.",
        "Verify each factual claim’s accuracy. Cross-check values against reliable sources (hypothetically) or the user-provided expected output. If dealing with known official tax schedules or widely documented details, ensure that no stated fact contradicts established data. The G-EVAL paper emphasizes factual correctness as critical for human alignment, especially when evaluating summarization and QAGS benchmarks.",
        "Consider the severity of errors. A minor misstatement or a slight numerical inaccuracy may lower the score slightly, while a glaring factual error that changes the fundamental meaning or provides entirely false information should drastically reduce the correctness score.",
        "Evaluate logical consistency as well. The response should not contain internal contradictions (e.g., stating both that land tax does not apply and then claiming it applies at a certain rate). According to G-EVAL guidelines, logical soundness underpins credibility and correctness."
